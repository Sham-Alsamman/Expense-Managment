# Expense-Managment-System
# Introduction 
In recent times, people’s need to know where they spend their money has increased because it’s hard to keep tracking with every little expense, and therefore we decided to make an expense management system.
In our project, we have built an expense management system that helps people to record their expenses and return to it to find out where they spent their money. Also, the user can engage his/her account with partners, so this helps the families and roommate know their expenses and help them save money.
The expense management system also offers scanning receipts and extracting information from them to speed up the expense logging process.


We face some challenges such as the need to learn new technology like Firebase .
